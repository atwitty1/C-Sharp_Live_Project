# C-Sharp_Live_Project
This is an ASP.Net MVC application for a theatre company.

## Introduction
Over the last 2 weeks, I was part of a sprint session for building a website for a Theatre Production Company. Them team that I was assigned yo was responsible for the part of the website sety aside for the production information, including cast member information storage. 

## Programming Languages used:
  - HTML
  - C#
    - Razor Syntax
  - CSS
    - Bootstrap
  - ASP.Net MVC
    -Entity Framework
  
Most of the webpage formatting and structure elements were build using HTML:

## C Sharp:
  Through this particular webpage most of the fucntionality was created using Code First programming in C#. 
  
 This application builds a Model for the database and creates that database from that model. Below is the DB model, with the Enums used for the Drop down menus.

 The model creates a DB, and using LINQ statements  and Razor Syntax the code retrieves that information and displays it to the view.

## Conclusion
  I would consider the last 2 weeks to be completely invaluable to my learning as a software developer. It was an opportunity to bring together most of the data gathered on this bootcamp and apply it to a list of cards (or challenges) that students complete, Using Azure DevOps and Visual Studio.
